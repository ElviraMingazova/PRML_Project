Pattern recognition and machine learning course project
This project consists of two parts: diabetes prediction using NHANES Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey) and malaria detection from blood smears pictures (https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria). The datasets have to be downloaded under the links above.
The code and comments can be found in the notebooks. Final report and the presentation are also included.
